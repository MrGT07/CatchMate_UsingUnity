# CatchMate_UsingUnity
"CatchMate!" is my new unity game for windows/mac devices. It's a simple 2D game developed for sake of simply practice around with Unity3D.

Game:
Move your bucket and catch sweet cherries:)
Score as many points as you can!

***Remember:***

You can also teleport your bucket from one side (left/right) of the screen to opposite side (right/left).(This to cover entire screen easily)

Controls:

"←" (Left Arrow) : To Go Left

"→" (Right Arrow): To Go Right

"Esc"            : To Pause Game
